### Description

Do your forms need more real estate without the use of Tabs or Frames? Then check out this Sliding Panel Container Control. This control offers a fresh look and feel with the ability to &#8220;host / contain&#8221; subsequent controls. Many of the features of this combination control are customizable (i.e. Backcolor, Frame Shape, Color &amp; Thickness, Rollup Speed, Button Type &amp; Offset, Hosted Controls Dis/Enable, Entire Control Dis/Enable, Transparent/Opaque Backstyle, Frame Thickness, Plus 10 Events!). Suggestions and comments are welcome, as this is the first cut. Tried to update project and PCS deleted the submission, so here it is again (07Jul05) TerriTop.
